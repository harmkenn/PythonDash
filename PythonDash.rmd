A simple scatter plot
In this example, you're going to make a scatter plot of female literacy vs fertility using data from the European Environmental Agency. This dataset highlights that countries with low female literacy have high birthrates. The x-axis data has been loaded for you as fertility and the y-axis data has been loaded as female_literacy.

Your job is to create a figure, assign x-axis and y-axis labels, and plot female_literacy vs fertility using the circle glyph.

After you have created the figure, in this exercise and the ones to follow, play around with it! Explore the different options available to you on the tab to the right, such as "Pan", "Box Zoom", and "Wheel Zoom". You can click on the question mark sign for more details on any of these tools.

Note: You may have to scroll down to view the lower portion of the figure.

Import the figure function from bokeh.plotting, and the output_file and show functions from bokeh.io.
Create the figure p with figure(). It has two parameters: x_axis_label and y_axis_label.
Add a circle glyph to the figure p using the function p.circle() where the inputs are, in order, the x-axis data and y-axis data.
Use the output_file() function to specify the name 'fert_lit.html' for the output file.
Create and display the output file using show() and passing in the figure p.

```{python}
# Import figure from bokeh.plotting
from bokeh.plotting import figure

# Import output_file and show from bokeh.io

A scatter plot with different shapes
By calling multiple glyph functions on the same figure object, we can overlay multiple data sets in the same figure.

In this exercise, you will plot female literacy vs fertility for two different regions, Africa and Latin America. Each set of x and y data has been loaded separately for you as fertility_africa, female_literacy_africa, fertility_latinamerica, and female_literacy_latinamerica.

Your job is to plot the Latin America data with the circle() glyph, and the Africa data with the x() glyph.

figure has already been imported for you from bokeh.plotting.

Create the figure p with the figure() function. It has two parameters: x_axis_label and y_axis_label.
Add a circle glyph to the figure p using the function p.circle() where the inputs are the x and y data from Latin America: fertility_latinamerica and female_literacy_latinamerica.
Add an x glyph to the figure p using the function p.x() where the inputs are the x and y data from Africa: fertility_africa and female_literacy_africa.
The code to create, display, and specify the name of the output file has been written for you, so after adding the x glyph, hit 'Submit Answer' to view the figure.

```{python}
from bokeh.io import output_file, show
from bokeh.plotting import figure
import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(0,10,1000)
y = np.sin(x) + np.random.random(1000)*.2

plot = figure()

plot.line(x,y)

output_file('numpy.html')
show(plot)
```

```{python}
from bokeh.io import output_file, show
from bokeh.plotting import figure

from bokeh.sampledata.iris import flowers

plot = figure()

plot.circle(flowers['petal_length'],
  flowers['sepal_length'],size = 10)
  
output_file('pandas.html')
show(plot)
```

Plotting data from NumPy arrays
In the previous exercises, you made plots using data stored in lists. You learned that Bokeh can plot both numbers and datetime objects.

In this exercise, you'll generate NumPy arrays using np.linspace() and np.cos() and plot them using the circle glyph.

np.linspace() is a function that returns an array of evenly spaced numbers over a specified interval. For example, np.linspace(0, 10, 5) returns an array of 5 evenly spaced samples calculated over the interval [0, 10]. np.cos(x) calculates the element-wise cosine of some array x.

For more information on NumPy functions, you can refer to the NumPy User Guide and NumPy Reference.

The figure p has been provided for you.

Import numpy as np.
Create an array x using np.linspace() with 0, 5, and 100 as inputs.
Create an array y using np.cos() with x as input.
Add circles at x and y using p.circle().

```{python}
# Import numpy as np
import numpy as np

# Create array using np.linspace: x
x = np.linspace(0,5,100)

# Create array using np.cos: y
y = np.cos(x)

p = figure()
# Add circles at x and y
p.circle(x,y)

# Specify the name of the output file and show the result
output_file('numpy.html')
show(p)
```

Plotting data from Pandas DataFrames
You can create Bokeh plots from Pandas DataFrames by passing column selections to the glyph functions.

Bokeh can plot floating point numbers, integers, and datetime data types. In this example, you will read a CSV file containing information on 392 automobiles manufactured in the US, Europe and Asia from 1970 to 1982.

The CSV file is provided for you as 'auto.csv'.

Your job is to plot miles-per-gallon (mpg) vs horsepower (hp) by passing Pandas column selections into the p.circle() function. Additionally, each glyph will be colored according to values in the color column.

Import pandas as pd.
Use the read_csv() function of pandas to read in 'auto.csv' and store it in the DataFrame df.
Import figure from bokeh.plotting.
Use the figure() function to create a figure p with the x-axis labeled 'HP' and the y-axis labeled 'MPG'.
Plot mpg (on the y-axis) vs hp (on the x-axis) by color using p.circle(). Note that the x-axis should be specified before the y-axis inside p.circle(). You will need to use Pandas DataFrame indexing to pass in the columns. For example, to access the color column, you can use df['color'], and then pass it in as an argument to the color parameter of p.circle(). Also specify a size of 10.

```{python}
# Import pandas as pd
import pandas as pd

# Read in the CSV file: df
df = pd.read_csv('auto.csv')

# Import figure from bokeh.plotting
from bokeh.plotting import figure

# Create the figure: p
p = figure(x_axis_label='HP', y_axis_label='MPG')

# Plot mpg vs hp by color
p.circle(df['hp'], df['mpg'], color=df['color'], size=10)

# Specify the name of the output file and show the result
output_file('auto-df.html')
show(p)

```

The Bokeh ColumnDataSource (continued)
You can create a ColumnDataSource object directly from a Pandas DataFrame by passing the DataFrame to the class initializer.

In this exercise, we have imported pandas as pd and read in a data set containing all Olympic medals awarded in the 100 meter sprint from 1896 to 2012. A color column has been added indicating the CSS colorname we wish to use in the plot for every data point.

Your job is to import the ColumnDataSource class, create a new ColumnDataSource object from the DataFrame df, and plot circle glyphs with 'Year' on the x-axis and 'Time' on the y-axis. Color each glyph by the color column.

The figure object p has already been created for you.

Import the ColumnDataSource class from bokeh.plotting.
Use the ColumnDataSource() function to make a new ColumnDataSource object called source from the DataFrame df.
Use p.circle() to plot circle glyphs on the figure p with 'Year' on the x-axis and 'Time' on the y-axis.
Make the size of the circles 8, and use color='color' to ensure each glyph is colored by the color column.
Make sure to specify source=source so that the ColumnDataSource object is used.

```{python}
# Import the ColumnDataSource class from bokeh.plotting
from bokeh.plotting import ColumnDataSource

df = pd.read_csv("Olym100.csv")
# Create a ColumnDataSource: source
source = ColumnDataSource(df)

p = figure(x_axis_label='Year', y_axis_label='Time')

# Add circle glyphs to the figure p
p.circle(x='Year', y='Time', color='color', size=8, source=source)

# Specify the name of the output file and show the result
output_file('sprint.html')
show(p)
